# Project Set Up:

  Before running the server, ensure that you've made the necessary modifications to the database connection names, such as the database URL. I am using MongoDB Compass to visually manage and interact with the MongoDB database, which helps in monitoring collections, running queries, and verifying data changes efficiently.

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run npm install to install all required dependencies from the package.json file.
3. After the installation is complete, use the command npm start to start the server.
4. Once the server is running, you can access the application in your browser using the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

# Warnings and Errors:

In my project, an error is triggered and returned if the user's name or ID already exists in the database, ensuring that each entry is unique and preventing duplicate records from being created.

# Key Dependencies used in the Project:

In my project, I use several key dependencies to enhance the functionality and development workflow:

a) Express for handling routing and building the server efficiently,

b) Nodemon for automatically restarting the server during development whenever file changes are detected,

c) Cookie-Parser to easily manage cookies in HTTP requests,

d) Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database using a schema-based solution, making data management more structured and efficient.


Each of these dependencies plays a crucial role in streamlining server operations, improving development efficiency, and ensuring seamless interaction with the database and client-side data.
