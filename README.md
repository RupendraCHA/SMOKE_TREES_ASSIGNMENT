# Project Set Up:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run npm install to install all required dependencies from the package.json file.
3. After the installation is complete, use the command npm start to start the server.
4. Once the server is running, you can access the application in your browser using the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

# Warnings and Errors:

In my project, an error is triggered and returned if the user's name or ID already exists in the database, ensuring that each entry is unique and preventing duplicate records from being created.

# Key Dependencies used in the Project:

In my project, I use several key dependencies to enhance the functionality and development workflow:

a) Express for handling routing and building the server efficiently,

b) Nodemon for automatically restarting the server during development whenever file changes are detected,

c) Cookie-Parser to easily manage cookies in HTTP requests,

d) Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database using a schema-based solution, making data management more structured and efficient.

<!-- a) Express: This is a flexible and lightweight web framework for Node.js, which simplifies the process of setting up routes, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses. It serves as the backbone of my server-side application, making it easier to manage the app’s structure and logic.

b) Nodemon: Nodemon is a development tool that automatically monitors changes in my source files and restarts the server whenever it detects any modifications. This eliminates the need to manually stop and start the server during development, greatly improving productivity and reducing development time.

c) Cookie-Parser: This middleware parses cookies attached to client requests, making it simple to read and manipulate cookies in the Express framework. It’s essential for managing user sessions, authentication, and storing small pieces of user information across multiple requests.

d) Mongoose: Mongoose provides a robust and schema-based solution for managing MongoDB databases. It allows me to define models for my data, perform validation, and handle complex queries more easily. It integrates well with Express and ensures data consistency within the MongoDB database, while also offering rich features like middleware, schema types, and population (joining documents). -->

Each of these dependencies plays a crucial role in streamlining server operations, improving development efficiency, and ensuring seamless interaction with the database and client-side data.
